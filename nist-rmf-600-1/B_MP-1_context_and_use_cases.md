## Purpose

To establish the intended domain, context, and application boundaries for AI and GenAI systems within hospital environments, ensuring use-case alignment with risk tolerance and ethical expectations.

## Scope

Applies to all AI/GenAI applications used in clinical, operational, and administrative contexts across the hospital system.

## Policy Statement

All AI system implementations must be contextually mapped to their operational environments. Use cases must be pre-approved based on risk profiles, patient safety, and adherence to regulatory requirements.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **AI Product Managers**: Define and document use case boundaries.
- **Clinical Leadership**: Validate clinical appropriateness of GenAI deployment.
- **Risk Officers**: Approve or escalate high-risk use case scenarios.

## Implementation Phases

### Must Do
- Conduct formal context definition and use case classification (AI RMF MAP-1.1).
- Prohibit dual-use deployment without revalidation (AI 600-1 ยง2.1).
- Map each GenAI system to a patient impact level (MAP-1.2).

### Should Do
- Review use case intent against FDA SaMD classification guidance.
- Document task substitution vs. augmentation role of GenAI.
- Include stakeholder input in use case validation (MAP-2.1).

### Recommended
- Apply scenario modeling or simulation-based evaluation before deployment.
- Re-map use cases annually or upon major version update.

## Review Cycle

Reviewed annually or when a new use case is introduced.
