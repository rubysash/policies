## Purpose

To require real-time and post-hoc monitoring of generative AI system behavior, with event logging for traceability, drift detection, incident response, and compliance with hospital policies.

## Scope

Covers all GenAI systems deployed in production environments, including clinical NLP tools, LLM-powered bots, and external API integrations with content generation capabilities.

## Policy Statement

All deployed GenAI systems must support active behavioral monitoring and log critical events—including model output anomalies, drift indicators, and inference boundary violations—to designated governance bodies and security tools.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **AI System Owners**: Ensure runtime telemetry, prompt/output logging, and drift detection are operational.
- **IT Security Team**: Integrate logs with SIEM and incident response pipelines (NIST 800-61r3).
- **Compliance & Risk**: Monitor logs for safety, privacy, and regulatory triggers.
- **Clinical Leads**: Validate alerts tied to clinical safety and patient interaction.

## Implementation Phases

### Must Do
- Log prompts and outputs under defined security classifications.
- Detect and alert on hallucination rate thresholds and unexpected behavior (AI 600-1 §2.3.1).
- Apply inference-time logging and model drift metrics (MANAGE-2.1).

### Should Do
- Use anomaly scoring and natural language output classifiers.
- Store logs in tamper-evident formats and retain per audit standards.
- Link logs to role-based dashboards for clinical governance review.

### Recommended
- Integrate logging with real-time safety triggers (e.g., “kill switches”).
- Apply federated signal sharing for jailbreaking and misuse indicators (top-AI-vuln #4, #6).
- Use synthetic output watermarking for downstream traceability (AI 600-1 §2.4.1).

## Review Cycle

Post-deployment and quarterly review; immediately after any detected model drift or safety incident.
