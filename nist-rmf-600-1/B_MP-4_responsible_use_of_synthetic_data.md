## Purpose

To govern the ethical and compliant use of synthetic data for training, fine-tuning, testing, and evaluating generative AI systems, particularly in contexts involving PHI, patient scenarios, or medical tasks.

## Scope

Applies to all hospital teams using synthetic data to train or evaluate GenAI tools, including LLMs, summarizers, dialogue agents, and structured data generators.

## Policy Statement

Synthetic data may be used to reduce risk, improve privacy, and support model generalization, but it must be generated, validated, and labeled responsibly. Misuse or over-reliance on synthetic data for critical clinical decisions is prohibited.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Data Scientists**: Tag synthetic datasets, document generation methods, and validate similarity to real distributions.
- **Compliance & Privacy**: Confirm synthetic data complies with HIPAA de-identification criteria and ONC interpretability standards.
- **AI Risk Committee**: Approve synthetic data use for clinical training or public sharing.

## Implementation Phases

### Must Do
- Label all synthetic datasets clearly and store separately from real PHI (AI RMF MAP-2.1).
- Confirm no re-identification risk using k-anonymity or other statistical tests (HIPAA ยง164.514(b)).
- Document source models, prompts, or rules used in data generation (AI 600-1 ยง2.2.1).

### Should Do
- Conduct outcome fidelity checks to ensure synthetic data do not introduce spurious correlations.
- Validate synthetic scenarios against clinical domain knowledge.
- Track model performance divergence when trained on synthetic vs. real data.

### Recommended
- Use synthetic data only as augmentation, not sole training input for safety-critical tasks.
- Report synthetic data usage in model cards or public documentation.
