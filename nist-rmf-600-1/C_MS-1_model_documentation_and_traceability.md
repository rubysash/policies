## Purpose

To ensure transparent, complete, and lifecycle-aligned documentation of datasets, model architectures, training parameters, and evaluation criteria used in hospital-deployed generative AI systems.

## Scope

Applies to all GenAI systems developed or deployed across clinical, administrative, and operational domains, including LLMs, NLP assistants, structured summarizers, and generative chat interfaces.

## Policy Statement

All GenAI systems must maintain detailed and accessible documentation encompassing data lineage, model structure, intended uses, known limitations, and prior evaluations. Documentation should support reproducibility, audit readiness, and regulatory disclosure.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Model Developers**: Maintain version-controlled records of datasets, model types, and fine-tuning configurations.
- **Compliance Officers**: Validate that documentation supports HIPAA audit, ONC certification, and FDA GMLP standards.
- **AI Risk Officers**: Review and update documentation in response to system changes or lifecycle transitions.

## Implementation Phases

### Must Do
- Maintain a "Model Factsheet" including training data origin, base model, and risk classification (AI RMF MAP-3.3, AI 600-1 ยง2.2).
- Document dataset composition, including any synthetic data and PHI filtering mechanisms.
- Version all fine-tuning steps, with associated datasets and performance metrics (SP 800-218A ยง3.2).

### Should Do
- Use model cards and datasheets for standardized disclosure.
- Annotate known limitations, bias risks, and hallucination rates.
- Integrate documentation into MLOps or software lifecycle tools.

### Recommended
- Share non-sensitive portions of documentation with third-party safety bodies.
- Include documentation of fallback behavior and safety interlocks.
