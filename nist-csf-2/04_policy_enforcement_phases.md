## Purpose
- Define a phased implementation strategy for cybersecurity controls based on organizational maturity and risk.
- Provide a structured approach to prioritize efforts and manage resource constraints.

## Scope
- Applies to all cybersecurity policies and procedures implemented across the hospital environment, including clinical systems, IT infrastructure, staff behavior, and third-party services.

## Policy Statement
- The hospital shall enforce cybersecurity policies using a tiered framework:
  - **Must Do**: Baseline requirements essential for protecting PHI and critical systems.
  - **Should Do**: Strongly recommended enhancements to strengthen defenses.
  - **Recommended**: Advanced measures for program maturity and optimization.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **Cybersecurity Governance Committee**: Determines which controls fall into each phase based on risk and feasibility.
- **CISO/IT Leadership**: Oversees phased implementation and tracks progress.
- **Compliance Team**: Ensures regulatory alignment at each phase.
- **Department Heads**: Support implementation of controls appropriate to their operational risk.
