## Purpose
- Provide a reference matrix mapping the hospital’s cybersecurity policies to applicable regulatory requirements and industry frameworks.
- Support compliance audits, internal assessments, and alignment with standards such as HIPAA, HITECH, and NIST CSF.

## Scope
- Applies to all hospital cybersecurity policy documents, risk management efforts, and regulatory compliance programs.

## Policy Statement
- The hospital shall maintain an up-to-date compliance matrix to demonstrate how cybersecurity policies address key regulatory and industry standards.
- This mapping will be reviewed periodically and updated to reflect changes in policy or external frameworks.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **Compliance Team**: Maintains the mapping; ensures alignment with HIPAA, HITECH, CMS, and state regulations.
- **CISO/Security Governance Team**: Ensures cybersecurity controls reflect the latest NIST CSF and HHS guidance.
- **Policy Owners**: Coordinate with Compliance to identify updates impacting mapped content.

## Implementation Phases

| Phase        | Activities                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Must Do      | Map each policy file to NIST CSF and relevant HIPAA Security Rule standards. |
| Should Do    | Include HITECH, CMS, and state-level requirements in the matrix.           |
| Recommended  | Publish mapping as part of audit preparation and internal awareness efforts. |

## Compliance Mapping Structure

- Each row represents a cybersecurity policy or control category.
- Columns reference relevant frameworks, including:
  - **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**
  - **HIPAA Security Rule (45 CFR Part 164, Subpart C)**
  - **HITECH Act**
  - **CMS Conditions of Participation**
  - **State-specific regulations (if applicable)**

## Sample Table Format

| Policy Section                  | NIST CSF           | HIPAA              | HITECH / Other      |
|----------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Access Control (`11_access_control.md`) | PR.AC-1 to PR.AC-7 | §164.312(a), §164.308(a)(4) | HITECH §13401        |
| Risk Assessment (`08_risk_assessment.md`) | ID.RA-1 to ID.RA-6 | §164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A) | HITECH §13402        |
| Incident Response (`20_response_planning.md`) | RS.RP-1             | §164.308(a)(6)         | HITECH §13402(d)(1)   |

## Review Cycle
- To be reviewed **annually**, or upon publication of revised frameworks, guidance from HHS or NIST, or updates to hospital cybersecurity policies.
