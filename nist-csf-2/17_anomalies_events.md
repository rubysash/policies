## Purpose
- Define requirements for detecting cybersecurity anomalies and events that may indicate security incidents or policy violations.
- Ensure timely identification of threats to hospital systems, patient data, and operations.

## Scope
- Applies to all hospital systems, networks, medical devices, cloud environments, and third-party services used to store, process, or transmit sensitive data.

## Policy Statement
- The hospital shall implement processes and technologies to detect unusual activity and potential security events across its digital environment.
- Detection capabilities must be maintained and updated to reflect changes in threats, systems, and risk exposure.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **Security Operations / IT Teams**: Configure and maintain monitoring tools; investigate suspicious activity.
- **CISO/Information Security Officer**: Define detection criteria, review logs, and escalate verified events.
- **System Owners**: Ensure logging is enabled and events are forwarded to central monitoring tools.
- **All Users**: Report observed anomalies or suspected unauthorized access immediately.

## Implementation Phases

| Phase        | Activities                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Must Do      | Enable basic logging on critical systems; define indicators of compromise. |
| Should Do    | Correlate logs from multiple sources; apply threat intelligence for anomaly detection. |
| Recommended  | Implement behavior-based analytics and integrate alerts into a SIEM platform. |
