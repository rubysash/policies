## Purpose
- Establish a framework for continuous monitoring of hospital systems and networks to detect security threats, policy violations, or operational anomalies.
- Support real-time visibility into system activity to enable timely incident detection and response.

## Scope
- Applies to all networked systems, servers, cloud platforms, medical devices, and applications that process or transmit sensitive or regulated data.

## Policy Statement
- The hospital shall implement continuous monitoring technologies and procedures to ensure ongoing awareness of information security threats and vulnerabilities.
- Monitoring shall include log aggregation, alerting, configuration monitoring, and performance analysis.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **Security/IT Teams**: Maintain monitoring tools, define alert thresholds, and respond to anomalies.
- **CISO/Information Security Officer**: Oversee monitoring strategy, report risk trends to leadership, and evaluate tool effectiveness.
- **System Owners**: Ensure logs and events are routed to central systems as required.
- **Third-Party Vendors**: Must support integration into monitoring platforms and adhere to alerting standards.
