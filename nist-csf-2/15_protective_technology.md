## Purpose
- Define the use of security technologies that protect hospital networks, systems, and data from cyber threats.
- Ensure protective measures are deployed, monitored, and maintained to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or compromise.

## Scope
- Applies to all IT infrastructure, cloud services, medical devices, and information systems connected to hospital networks or handling sensitive data.

## Policy Statement
- The hospital shall implement technical safeguards including firewalls, endpoint protection, intrusion detection/prevention, segmentation, and logging to protect against cybersecurity threats.
- Technologies must be configured, maintained, and monitored in alignment with best practices and risk assessments.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **IT and Security Teams**: Deploy and manage protective technologies; configure alerts, monitor logs, and respond to threats.
- **System Owners**: Ensure systems under their purview comply with configuration and security requirements.
- **Vendors and Managed Service Providers**: Follow hospital security standards when managing or integrating technology.
- **Executive Leadership**: Approve major security technology investments and review effectiveness reports.
