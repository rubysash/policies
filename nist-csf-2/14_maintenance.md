## Purpose
- Define requirements for maintaining hospital information systems, software, and devices to ensure security and operational integrity.
- Ensure timely application of updates, patches, and configuration changes that protect systems from vulnerabilities.

## Scope
- Applies to all hospital-owned or -managed hardware, software, operating systems, applications, and networked medical devices that process or store sensitive information.

## Policy Statement
- The hospital shall implement a structured maintenance program that includes scheduled updates, emergency patches, and secure maintenance procedures for all critical systems.
- Maintenance activities shall minimize operational disruption while preserving system confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **IT and Security Teams**: Coordinate and execute system updates, maintain baselines, and validate patches.
- **Clinical Engineering/Biomedical Teams**: Maintain software and firmware of medical devices in coordination with IT.
- **Vendors and Third-Party Maintainers**: Must follow secure maintenance protocols and hospital authorization procedures.
- **Department Managers**: Ensure systems under their control receive timely maintenance per policy.
