## Outline

## Purpose
- Define the phased approach for enforcing AI and GenAI governance policies across different maturity levels and risk classes.
- Enable scalable adoption while prioritizing safety-critical controls first.

## Scope
- Applies to all hospital AI/GenAI systems and stakeholders involved in governance, procurement, deployment, and oversight.

## Policy Statement
- Enforcement of AI governance shall follow a phased structure: **Must Do**, **Should Do**, and **Recommended**.
- GenAI-specific risks (e.g., hallucination, prompt injection, misuse) must be prioritized in all phases.

## Enforcement Phases

### Phase 1 – Must Do (Baseline Compliance)
- Maintain AI system inventory
- Perform GenAI-specific risk assessments
- Track hallucination and prompt vulnerabilities
- Define governance roles
- Require intake forms for all new AI/GenAI systems

### Phase 2 – Should Do (Operational Governance)
- Conduct bias and fairness assessments
- Implement human-in-the-loop review for high-impact outputs
- Monitor GenAI KPIs (e.g., hallucination rate, drift)
- Formalize lifecycle checkpoints
- Use incident templates for GenAI-related failures

### Phase 3 – Recommended (Governance Maturity)
- Automate compliance and drift alerts
- Integrate GenAI transparency into patient communication
- Publish trustworthiness metrics
- Participate in external benchmarking and safety networks

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **AI Governance Committee**: Defines phase enforcement schedule and accountability.
- **Compliance and Risk Teams**: Monitor adherence and escalate non-compliance.
- **Department Heads**: Implement phase-aligned practices in local workflows.

## Implementation Timeline
- Phase 1: Immediate – foundational enforcement
- Phase 2: Within 6–12 months of system deployment
- Phase 3: Ongoing as maturity grows
