## Outline

## Purpose
- Establish a comprehensive governance structure for managing AI and GenAI risks across the hospital ecosystem.
- Align AI oversight with ethical, clinical, regulatory, and technological expectations, including GenAI-specific threats.

## Scope
- Applies to all AI/GenAI systems—clinical, operational, and patient-facing—across the hospital.
- Covers both in-house systems and vendor technologies.

## Policy Statement
- The hospital shall operate a centralized, multidisciplinary AI Governance Framework to ensure ethical and compliant deployment of AI/GenAI.
- Governance must be proactive, risk-aware, and adaptive to GenAI’s evolving risk landscape (e.g., hallucination, misuse, prompt vulnerability).

## Framework Components

### AI Governance Committee
- Strategic oversight and enterprise-wide risk alignment.

### Clinical AI Review Board
- Evaluation of clinical use, patient safety, and standard-of-care alignment.

### Ethics and Equity Panel
- Assessment of fairness, bias, and harm to vulnerable populations.

### IT and Security Teams
- Infrastructure, prompt safety, data governance, and auditability.

### Legal and Compliance
- Regulatory conformance (HIPAA, FDA, ONC, etc.), contracts, and breach readiness.

### Departmental Stewards
- Embedded experts responsible for context-specific oversight (e.g., Radiology, Emergency, Operations).

## Principles of Governance

- Transparency and documentation of AI/GenAI intent and limitations
- Role-based accountability for decisions and outcomes
- Risk-tiered governance proportional to impact and use case
- GenAI-specific oversight of prompt libraries, hallucination tracking, and misuse pathways

## Implementation Phases

### Must Do
- Establish and formally charter the AI Governance Committee and relevant subcommittees.
- Define roles, meeting cadence, and decision-making scope.

### Should Do
- Require governance approval for all medium-to-high risk GenAI deployments.
- Track committee decisions and risk exceptions in a governance log.

### Recommended
- Publish an annual governance report on AI/GenAI usage and oversight maturity.
