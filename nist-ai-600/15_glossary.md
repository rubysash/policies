## Outline

## Purpose
- Define key terms used in the hospital’s AI and Generative AI risk policies.
- Ensure consistent understanding across multidisciplinary teams, including legal, clinical, technical, and executive stakeholders.

## Scope
- Applies to all terms used within this AI Risk Policy Framework.
- Terms reflect definitions from NIST AI RMF, NIST AI 600-1, HIPAA, FDA, and ONC guidance where applicable.

## Glossary

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The capability of computer systems to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, including reasoning, learning, and decision-making.

- **Generative AI (GenAI)**: AI models that generate novel content such as text, images, audio, or data. In healthcare, often used for summarization, documentation, or patient engagement.

- **Hallucination**: A phenomenon where a GenAI system generates outputs that are syntactically plausible but factually incorrect, misleading, or fabricated.

- **Prompt Injection**: A type of attack where adversarial input is used to manipulate GenAI outputs or bypass safety constraints.

- **Bias (in AI)**: Systematic and repeatable errors in a model’s output that result in unfair outcomes across demographic or clinical subgroups.

- **PHI (Protected Health Information)**: Individually identifiable health information regulated under HIPAA, including any information that can be linked to a patient.

- **Fine-Tuning**: The process of adjusting a pre-trained model to perform better on specific tasks or domains using additional data.

- **Synthetic Data**: Artificially generated data that mimics real data characteristics but does not contain actual patient records.

- **Zero-Shot Learning**: The ability of a GenAI model to perform a task without having seen direct examples during training.

- **Explainability**: The degree to which a human can understand the cause or reasoning behind a model’s output.

- **Prompt Engineering**: The practice of crafting inputs to GenAI models to elicit desired and safe outputs.

## Review Cycle
- Reviewed annually or when:
  - New terms are introduced in policy updates
  - NIST, FDA, or HIPAA issue updated definitions relevant to AI
