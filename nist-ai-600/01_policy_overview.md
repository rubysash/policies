## Outline

## Purpose
- Describe the overall intent of the hospital's AI and Generative AI (GenAI) risk management policy.
- Establish alignment with NIST AI RMF Core and AI 600-1.
- Emphasize commitment to safe, ethical, and effective use of AI in clinical and operational settings.

## Scope
- Applies to all AI and GenAI systems deployed or evaluated in the hospital environment.
- Covers clinical, operational, administrative, and patient-facing use cases.
- Includes AI-generated text, synthetic data, decision support, summarization, and ambient tools.

## Policy Statement
- Affirmation of the hospital’s dedication to trustworthy, compliant, and transparent AI usage.
- Core principles for GenAI adoption (e.g., human oversight, bias mitigation, hallucination control).
- Integration of risk-based approach for AI system lifecycle management.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- Reference to designated roles as defined in `02_roles_responsibilities.md`.
- High-level accountability for oversight, deployment, and risk review of GenAI tools.

## Implementation Phases

### Must Do
- Define and publish AI use principles aligned with NIST AI RMF and AI 600-1 (§2.1).
- Identify prohibited or high-risk GenAI uses (e.g., autonomous diagnosis).
- Maintain a centralized registry of AI/GenAI deployments.

### Should Do
- Integrate GenAI-specific risk criteria into IT and clinical procurement workflows.
- Establish an internal AI Ethics Review process for high-impact systems.

### Recommended
- Perform regular risk maturity assessments using AI RMF profiles.
- Benchmark GenAI governance practices against external healthcare and standards bodies.
