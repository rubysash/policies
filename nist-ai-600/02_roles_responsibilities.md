## Outline

## Purpose
- Define the governance structure and responsible parties overseeing AI and GenAI deployment in the hospital.
- Ensure accountability across legal, clinical, IT, compliance, and operational domains.
- Support traceability, oversight, and responsible use of generative AI technologies.

## Scope
- Applies to all individuals and bodies involved in the selection, implementation, monitoring, or oversight of AI/GenAI tools.
- Covers both internally developed and third-party AI solutions integrated into hospital workflows.

## Policy Statement
- The hospital shall maintain a clearly defined governance model with designated roles to manage AI risks.
- Responsibilities must address GenAI-specific challenges including hallucination, misuse, and ethical oversight.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### AI Governance Committee
- Oversight of enterprise-wide AI policy and strategy.
- Reviews high-risk and GenAI-enabled systems.
- Coordinates with legal, compliance, and ethics review boards.

### Clinical AI Review Board
- Evaluates clinical safety and appropriateness of AI/GenAI use in patient care.
- Reviews accuracy, bias risks, and alignment with clinical practice standards.

### Chief Information Officer (CIO) / IT Department
- Responsible for technical integration, security, and access controls.
- Maintains AI system inventory and data lineage records.

### Chief Medical Information Officer (CMIO)
- Coordinates with clinical leaders on AI/GenAI workflow integration and user acceptance.

### Legal and Compliance Teams
- Assesses regulatory risks including HIPAA, FDA, and ONC compliance.
- Oversees incident response and breach reporting for AI/GenAI-related harms.

### AI Risk Manager / AI Steward (if designated)
- Manages risk assessments, documentation, and system performance reviews.
- Ensures GenAI-specific risks (e.g., hallucination rates, prompt injection) are tracked and mitigated.

## Implementation Phases

### Must Do
- Appoint a multi-disciplinary AI Governance Committee.
- Define GenAI oversight roles with authority to pause or veto deployments.
- Require role-based training on GenAI risks and compliance obligations.

### Should Do
- Establish a centralized AI/GenAI oversight charter approved by executive leadership.
- Create escalation paths for GenAI-related incidents or ethical concerns.

### Recommended
- Designate “AI Stewards” in high-risk departments (e.g., emergency, radiology).
- Incorporate GenAI oversight roles into clinical quality and safety review processes.
