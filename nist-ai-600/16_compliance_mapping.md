## Outline

## Purpose
- Provide a clear crosswalk between the hospital’s AI/GenAI governance practices and applicable regulatory and standards frameworks.
- Ensure visibility into how policies align with NIST AI RMF Core, NIST AI 600-1, HIPAA, FDA, and ONC requirements.

## Scope
- Covers all policy modules in this repository.
- Maps each section to the relevant compliance controls and guidance sources.
- Focuses on areas where generative AI introduces novel risks or regulatory considerations.

## Policy Statement
- The hospital shall maintain a living compliance map to ensure AI/GenAI governance remains aligned with federal and industry standards.
- All AI-related policies must be traceable to relevant compliance sources, including risk-specific GenAI controls.

## Compliance Frameworks

### NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF Core)
- Categories: Govern, Map, Measure, Manage
- Control identifiers: GOV-1 to MG-9

### NIST AI 600-1 Generative AI Profile
- Focused controls on hallucination, prompt safety, system explainability, and misuse mitigation
- Sections: §2.1 through §2.5

### HIPAA Security Rule
- Primary reference: §164.308 – Security management process
- Covers risk analysis, workforce training, access control, and incident response

### FDA AI/ML-Based SaMD Action Plan
- Risk classification and pre/post-market requirements
- Algorithm change protocols and post-deployment monitoring

### ONC Health IT Certification
- Relevant to AI embedded in certified health IT systems
- Includes auditability, transparency, and data provenance requirements

## Implementation Phases

### Must Do
- Maintain up-to-date compliance mapping for each AI/GenAI policy section.
- Ensure high-risk GenAI systems meet applicable HIPAA and FDA criteria.

### Should Do
- Review AI/GenAI governance against ONC certification for EHR-integrated tools.
- Validate that GenAI safety mitigations align with 600-1 Profile expectations.

### Recommended
- Use mapping to support regulatory audits, external benchmarking, and internal training.
- Integrate compliance checks into AI lifecycle management workflows.
